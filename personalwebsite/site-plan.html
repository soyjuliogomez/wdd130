        [Hello, I'm Julio, I'm a UI Designer with more than 8 years of experience, I really enjoy the whole process of designing interfaces for mobile and desktop applications.
        My abilities:
        <br><br>
        I am very good at all design processes but my main skills as a UI Designer are:
        UI design
        This is my favorite part of the product design phase. I enjoy defining the components and styles.
        <br><br>
        UX Design:<br><br>
        I apply my knowledge in wireframes, I make a mental tour of each process of the product.
        At this point my analytical and conceptual part comes to light with respect to the way of designing the design flows of a product, in this part my creativity flows with respect to organizing information and finding the best process so that the user has an excellent experience with the product that I am designing.
        <br><br>
        Design Systems:<br><br>
        In this part I have a very deep knowledge of the atomic design methodology, here I carefully organize the components and styles to create a scalable design system that helps optimize product development.
        
        My home portfolio:<br><br>
        Because I am constantly designing user interfaces I have a robust portfolio in which you can see my style of work applied in different theme environments, look at my main projects and if you want to see more about my portfolio go to the portfolio page where you will find the project completed and with more details.
        
        
        Testimonials from my clients.<br><br>
